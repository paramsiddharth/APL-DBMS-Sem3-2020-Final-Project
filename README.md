# Bus Booking System - Project
The final project for submission in semester 3,
Advanced Programming Laboratory and Database
Systems.

## Features
- Add buses with date, timings, and "from" and "to"
  data.
- Query buses based on client's requirements in a
  user-friendly environment.
- Buy tickets, which themselves are logged using
  an SQL TRIGGER.
- Pure usage of SQLite 3 for file-based data storage.
- UI implemented entirely in Tkinter.
- Powerful error-handling; Negligible chances of
  failure.

## Dependencies
- Python 3.8+
- Tkinter

## Development
- If on Linux, install Tkinter.
  ``` bash
  sudo apt-get install python-tk
  ```
- While making sure the appropriate filesystem
  permissions are given,
  start `main.py` using Python 3.
  ``` bash
  python3 main.py
  ```
An SQLite database will be created in `data.db`, which
will be used by the application for storage.
